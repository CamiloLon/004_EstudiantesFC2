# THE FOLLOWING  NUMBERS CORRESPONDS TO THE ENERGIES OF THE  9 configs of  L^2 = 144 COMPONENTS EACH
#
# TEMPERATURE  T = 1.8
#
# Note that for J=1 and a par L, the theoretical maximum energy is 2*L^2 and the miminum energy is -2*L^2. For low temperatures, E->E_min is expected; for high temperatures, E->0 is expected
